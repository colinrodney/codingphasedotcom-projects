Routing in Express:

Supports routes to extensions such as:

app.get(`/about.txt`, (req, res) =>{
        // res.send(`<h1> About Page</h1>`)
})


> 
Can send back plain HTML w/. express:

app.get(`/`, (req, res) =>{
        // res.send(`<h1> About Page</h1>`)
})

>
Using parameters in routes:

app.get("/user/:username/:state", (req, res) =>{
    let userInfo = req.params;
    res.send(`<p>Hello ${userInfo.username}!</p>`)
})


Using query parameters in routes:

URL:
http://localhost:3000/user/colin/Louisiana/?age=42&occupation=something&car=ford

router.get("/user/:username/:state", (req, res) =>{
    let userInfo = req.params; 
    let query = req.query; 
    res.send(`<p>Hello ${userInfo.username}. You're from ${userInfo.state} right?
    You are ${query.age} and your occupation is
    ${query.occupation} and you drive a ${query.car}</p>`)
})

NOTE: 
Query parameters are anything that comes after the question mark
(?) in a URL, (See above URL).
